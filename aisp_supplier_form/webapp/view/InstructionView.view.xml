This Form is a part of Prequalification Document and the Potential Vendor is expected to carefully examine all instructions, templates, and terms and conditions, and to provide the Company with all information or documentation required for the purpose of registration and prequalification, so that the Company can properly assess the Potential Vendor's application in light of the Company's requirements.
